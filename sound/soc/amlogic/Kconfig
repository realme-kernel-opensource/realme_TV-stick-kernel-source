	help
	  Say Y or M if you want to add support for codecs attached to

	  to select the audio interfaces to support below.

config AMLOGIC_SND_SOC_AUGE
	bool "Amlogic Auge Asoc"
	depends on AMLOGIC_SND_SOC
	default y if AMLOGIC_SND_SOC=m || AMLOGIC_SND_SOC=y
	help
	  Say Y or M if you want to add support for audio arch Auge
	  to the Amlogic Asoc Interface. it is a new audio arch to
	  distinguish Meson audio arch. it is base on kernel 4.9

	default y if AMLOGIC_SND_SOC=m || AMLOGIC_SND_SOC=y
	help
		Say Y or M if you want to add support for common interface attached to

	depends on AMLOGIC_GKI
	help
		Say Y or M if you want to add support for sound
